Certflare is an easier and quicker way to your certs from certbot/letsencrypt/ietf.
Why make your own script when something does it better and easier, especially if you don't know ruby.

Just install this, run xxxxx and you'll be on your way,  
and certbot and certflare will work together to keep  
your certificates valid.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
